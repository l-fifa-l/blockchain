# Blockchain In JavaScript

## Getting Started

The first step in running this project is to run `npm install`.
Then run various nodes using `npm run node_1`, `npm run node_2`, `npm run node_3`, `npm run node_4`, `npm run node_5`

## Course Content

In this course you will build out your very own **blockchain** and **decentralized blockchain network** using the javascript programming language.

In this course you will learn all of the following concepts and your blockchain will have all of the following features:

- A **proof of work** algorithm to secure the network.
- **Hashing algorithms** to secure the data within the blockchain.
- The ability to **mine (create) new blocks** that contain data.
- The ability to **create transactions** and store them in blocks.
- An **API/server** that will be used to interact with the blockchain from the internet.
- It will be hosted on a **decentralized blockchain network**.
- A **consensus algorithms** to verify that the network nodes have valid data and are synchronized.
- A **broadcasting system** to keep the data in the blockchain network synchronized.
- Many other awesome features!...
